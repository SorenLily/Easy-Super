Easy Super is a mod for Sonic 3 AIR, which adds multiple settings to customize to the Super Forms:

- "Go Super Then Hyper": Allows you to transform from Base -> Super -> Hyper, instead of only from Base -> Hyper.
- Customize ring requirements and ring drain rate for the Super and Hyper forms, including disabling them entirely.
- "Always Super": Allows you to set your base form to be Super or Hyper and run around in that form for the entire game.
- "Super Form Ring Magnet": When enabled, grants the ring magnetism of the Lightning Shield whenever you are in a Super form.
- "Hyper Flash Brightness": Allows you to dim the brightness of Sonic's Hyper Flash.
- "Doomsday Zone Form": When set to "Super Only," you will always enter DDZ in Super form.

If you encounter any bugs or issues with this mod, let me know and I may address it. I am aware that playing as Hyper Tails all the time causes some palette issues, such as with Signposts and with Flickies released from capsules. Unfortunately, there is not much I can do about this.

A big thanks to my friend Blackstorm on this one. Most of the design and ideas for this mod came from him.
